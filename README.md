# Example Python Projects
This repository is currently used to upload past and previous computing projects, to showcase my proficiency in using Python and any relevant libraries. I'll also give a brief overview of each project in this document. Many thanks! 

### Projects 1: A Monte Carlo Model of Neutron Penetration:
This project was completed in 2022, as part of the "Computational Physics" module taken during my second year of Physics at the University of Manchester.
