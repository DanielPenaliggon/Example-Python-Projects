# Example Python Projects

**Objective:** This repository is intended as a portfolio of my more polished projects using the coding language Python, and for my ability to use code to manage, manipulate and present data. I've included a brief bio for each of the attached projects below. Many thanks! 

### Project 1: A Monte Carlo Model of Neutron Penetration: - 2022
**History:** This project was completed in 2022, as part of the "Computational Physics" module taken during my second year of Physics at the University of Manchester. 

### Project 2: Analysing Capnogram Time Series Data for Binary Classification - March, 2025 (ongoing)
**History:** Started in March 2025, and currently ongoing! Jupyter notebook detailing the data cleaning, feature engineering, and ML model (gradient boost) building, relating to the classificaton of a set of capnograms (CO2 time series, as measured over a single exhale), by a binary characteristic. Sections 1,2 and 3 are exploratory, with their final findings being neatly bundled and used in section 4, the ML model application step. 
**requires:** capnogram_data.json (to be in same folder when run!)
